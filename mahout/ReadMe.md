## What is Mahout
It is an Apache open source Machine Learning library. It provides machine learning algorithms focused in the areas of collaborative filtering, clustering and classification.
Here are some of its main use cases:
* Recommendations (Collaborative filtering) - The recommendation engine tries to infer tastes and preferences and identify unknown items that are of interest.
* Clustering - Clustering techniques attempt to group a large number of things together into clusters that share some similarity. It’s a way to discover hierarchy and order in a large or hard-to-understand data set, and in that way reveal interesting patterns or make the data set easier to comprehend.
* Classification - Classification techniques decide how much a thing is or isn’t part of some type or category, or how much it does or doesn’t have some attribute.
